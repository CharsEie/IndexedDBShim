# Version 4.0.0

## Upgrading from version 3.* to 4.0.0

- Due to changes from Babel 6 to Babel 7, the polyfill required for
    IndexedDB to work on older browsers and environments (assuming
    IndexedDBShim currently supports them), script tag references to
    `node_modules`-based paths of `babel-polyfill` will need to be
    changed to `@babel/polyfill`
- Numeric constants had previously been accepted as second arguments to
    `IDBDatabase.prototype.transaction` in IndexedDB, but were deprecated.
    IndexedDBShim also deprecated their use, and now we are dropping support.
    Please use `"readonly"` or `"readwrite"` instead.
