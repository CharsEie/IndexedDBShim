These tests come from <https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/IndexedDB>
(courtesy of [idb-polyfill](https://github.com/treojs/idb-polyfill)) but they
are designed to run in a web browser, which is annoying for this project. So
they were converted to Mocha tests, hopefully without losing anything.

Run these tests in Node by running `npm run w3c`.
